## Taks
1. Create a new project `rails new`
1. Scaffold a resource `Project` with a `name` and a `description` as a `string`
1. Validates the presence of `name`
1. Generate a controller `StaticPages` with an action `home`
1. Change the content of the new action to `Welcome all`
1. Prevent the `destroy` action for `Project` model (through the routes)
1. Set `StaticPages#home` as the root of the web app
1. Add (manually) a new action to the `StaticPages` called `privacy` and accesible via `/privacy`
1. Add (manually) a new action to the `StaticPages` called `terms` and accesible via `/legal`
1. Add a route to access `StaticPages#terms` (Create on last step) via `/legal-terms`
1. Add (manually) a new action to the `StaticPages` called `location` and accesible via `/location`
1. Change the action `StaticPages#location` to render a view `map` when we try to access `/location?view=map`
1. Generate a migration adding the field `rating` as a `float` to the model `Project`
1. Add a validation to `Project` model to accept only `rating` values between `1` and `5` included.
1. Generate a model `Todo` with a `label` as a `string` and a `project` as a `references`
1. Look into the new model file to see what was generated
1. Look into the `schema` file and look what was generated
1. Validates the presence of `label`
1. Test within the rails console
1. **Pretend** to scaffold the controller
1. Find the right arguments to skip the existing model files
1. Add a `has_many` relation in `Project` to show all its related `Todo`
1. Restrict the access to `Todo#index` in the routing file
1. Display the `todos` of a `Project` in the `Project#index` endpoint
1. Generate a migration to add `priority` attribute to `Todo` as a `integer`
1. Declare this field as an `enum` in `Todo` model with the possible values of `:high`, `:medium`, `:low`
1. Add the class method `total` to `Project` in order to get `Project.total` returning the amount of projects in the data base
1. Add the class method `total` to `Todo` in order to get `Todo.total` returning the amount of todos in the data base
1. The sentence `We currently have n todos within n projects` to the home page. Both `n` should refer to the newly created class methods and `todos` and `projects` should plurialize according to the amount.
1. Do training (1) listed below if you need a refresh of the points we went trough.
1. Create a model `Task` with fields `done` as a `boolean`, `label` as a `string`, `todo` as a reference
1. Test `label` is present
1. Test `label` is unique through the `Todo`
1. Test `todo` is required
1. Test `done` is `false` at creation
1. Test `Task` gets deleted when we delete parent `Todo`
1. Test `project` is exists
1. Test `Task` gets deleted when we delete parent `Project`
1. Generate a mailer `ProjectMailer` with `notify_admin` sending an email saying `New project NAME was created. Accese HERE` where NAME is the name of the project and HERE is a url to the project.
1. Call the mailer from `project#create` when the creation is a success
1. Add a method `open_tasks` to `Todo` returning  the current open tasks in it
1. Add a method `open_tasks` to `Todo` returning a `booblean` regarding if it still has open tasks
1. Change the `destroy` method of `todo` to raise an `StandardError` when we try to delete a `Todo` with open `tasks`
1. Add 3 images representing `:high`, `:medium`, `:low` priority
1. Display the image corresponding the `priority` of a `Todo` from the assets in the corresponding views
1. Move the code you just wrote to `todos_helper.rb`
1. Add a logo to the `public` folder and display it on every page
